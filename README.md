We live in a world of "Choice overload", especially when it comes to choosing something to watch. With the vast array of streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Binge, Apple TV‚Ä¶the list goes on‚Ä¶we are flooded with an overwhelming number of movies and TV shows to watch..

Consider a usual scenario where you're browsing Netflix with your friends, aiming to select a movie for the evening.  Each person might have different preferences - some might prefer a chilling thriller, others a light-hearted comedy, or a thought-provoking documentary. Some might want to catch up on recent releases, while others are in the mood for a nostalgic classic.

Excessive choices often lead to endless scrolling, indecisiveness, and can make movie night a chore. This "choice overload" results in decision fatigue, causing dissatisfaction or no decision at all.

When we're flooded with too many choices, it can get so overwhelming that we end up not making a decision at all. This is called **"choice paralysis"**. Even then, if we do manage to choose something from a huge list of options, we often feel less happy with our pick than if we had fewer options to choose from.

That being said, it is fantastic that we have all these options - more options usually leads to  achieving better objective outcomes. Suppose you're looking to buy a new pair of jeans. You're more likely to find what you like in a store with 50 pairs of jeans than in a small store with only 2 pairs.

Choice is good, but choice is paralysing - so how do we overcome this challenge, even when deciding something as simple as what movie to watch next?


## The App (or the intended app)
The app is an work in progress project focused on simplifying movie selection with features like mood-based quizzes, swipe-based recommendations, and collaborative tools. It‚Äôs designed to make finding movies more enjoyable and collaborative. Currently, it includes a tournament-style feature where users select between random movie pairs until a final "winner" is chosen. Built with a Next.js frontend and Flask backend.
